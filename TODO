A) FIX cm key upload

cm key load

    will generate id_rsa in keys

cm key upload

   will find id_rsa and upload to cloud with name

   <username>-key

    right now it uploads only if you specify the keyname

    cm key upload id_rsa

    its inconvenient to even think about the naming

    if the key id_rsa does not exists the first key in the db will be used,
    if no key is in the db a nice error msg should be printed
    no exception ...


what we may want

cm key upload --cloud=all
cm key upload --name=id_rsa --cloud=all
cm key upload --cloud=kilo,chameleon
cm key upload --name=id_rsa,otherkey --cloud=kilo,chameleon

see docopts 

--name=KEY... instead of -name=KEY
--name=CLOUD... instead of -cloud=CLOUD

if no name is specified use id_rsa if that does not exists take first key form key db table

cm key upload  # applied to id_rsa key and default cloud



WHAT

cm load
cm upload
