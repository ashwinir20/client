Register Command
======================================================================


Registering different clouds with the cloudmesh register command is easy. We
 have a number of predefined templates that are stored in the ~/.cloudmesh
 .yaml file that you can use and modify. However for some clouds such as the
  once at IU an easy registration exists if you have appropriate access.

The manual page of the register command can be found at:
`register <../man/man.html#register>`_


Quickstart for registration of some clouds
----------------------------------------------

Please only use the quickstart if you know hat you are doing, otherwise,
read the manual. We assume you have access to the specific clouds that you
like to access. On a terminal say::

    cm register remote kilo

to register the FutureSystems kilo cloud

More information about the cloud can be found at

* https://portal.futuresystems.org

To register an openstack cloud for which you have an existing openrc.sh file,
you can simply say::

    cm register openrc.sh

.. todo:: verify if this works

On chameleoncloud.org you can for example go to the horizon web interface and
download the credentials in the security panel.


Introduction
--------------

As we are managing multiple clouds with cloudmesh we need to register
them first. To make it easy for you cloudmesh reads the registered
clouds from an easy to manage yaml file. This yam file is installed by
default into the file::

    ~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml

A number of templates in that file exist that refer to commonly used
clouds. YOu can fill out the yaml file with your information, add new
clouds, or delete templates of clouds that you do not use. We have
several different types of clouds that we support. This includes
OpenStack, AWS, and Azure clouds.

.. todo:: at this time we have not integrated our AWS and Azure IaaS
	  abstractions in the new cloudmesh client. We will make them available in
	  future.

.. note in some of our examples we will be using the user name `albert`

As it may be inconvenient to edit this file and look at the yaml
format, we provide several administrative commands. The command::

  $ register info

  File /Users/albert/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml exists. ok.

identifies if the `cloudmesh.yaml` file exists.

To view the contents of that file, you can cat it or use the command::

  register cat

To edit the file, you can use the command::

  register edit


register list
-------------

To list the clouds that are defined in the cloudmesh.yaml file, you
can use the command::

  $ register list

which will print a table with elementary information defined for the
clouds.::

    $ register list
    Clouds specified in the configuration file ~/.cloudmesh\cloudmesh.yaml

    +-------+-----------+---------+
    | Name  | Iaas      | Version |
    +-------+-----------+---------+
    | azure | azure     | N/A     |
    | aws   | ec2       | N/A     |
    | kilo  | openstack | kilo    |
    +-------+-----------+---------+

To list only the names, please use the command::

    $ register list --name
    Clouds specified in the configuration file ~/.cloudmesh\cloudmesh.yaml

    +-------+
    | Name  |
    +-------+
    | azure |
    | aws   |
    | india |
    | kilo  |
    +-------+

As we also have to sometimes login to some remote hosts it is
convenient to reuse the ssh command for that. ssh has the advantage of
being able to use a config file in $HOME/.ssh/config. MOre information
about ssh config files and their format can be found in the many web
pages if you google for `ssh config`. In case you have defined 
a host `india` in ~/.ssh/config in the following way:

    Host india
        Hostname india.futuresystems.org
        User yourusername

The list command followed by ssh will give  you a list of hosts defined
in that file::

    $ cm register list ssh

    india


register remote
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In case you already use an openstack cloud you may have come across an
openrc.sh file. We are providing some very special helper functions, like
for example obtain the openrc files from the FutureSystems
cloud.

The command::

  register remote HOSTNAME

will copy and register a machine on which an openrc.sh file is located into
the `cloudmesh.yaml` file. With cloudmesh we provide some default host, thus
 they are very easy to configure. This includes `kilo` our
 current clouds in our lab. To register them you can use the commands::

    cm register reomte kilo

These commands will only work if you have an account on this
machine and it is integrated into the ssh config file as discussed
previously.

register export
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To view the data associated with a particular cloud you can just use the
command export::

    register export kilo --format=table

Which will look like this::

    +-----------------------+------------------------------------------+
    | Attribute             | Value                                    |
    +-----------------------+------------------------------------------+
    | OS_PASSWORD           | ********                                 |
    | OS_VOLUME_API_VERSION | 2                                        |
    | OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION  | 2                                        |
    | OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID  | default                                  |
    | OS_USER_DOMAIN_ID     | default                                  |
    | OS_TENANT_NAME        | fg1234                                   |
    | OS_PROJECT_NAME       | fg1234                                   |
    | OS_USERNAME           | albert                                   |
    | OS_AUTH_URL           | https://kilo.futuresystems.org:5000/v3   |
    | OS_VERSION            | kilo                                     |
    | OS_OPENRC             | ~/.cloudmesh/clouds/india/kilo/openrc.sh |
    +-----------------------+------------------------------------------+

The default view returns a openrc.sh file::

    cm register export kilo

The output contains an rc file example::

    export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID=default
    export OS_USERNAME=albert
    export OS_OPENRC=~/.cloudmesh/clouds/india/kilo/openrc.sh
    export OS_AUTH_URL=https://kilo.futuresystems.org:5000/v3
    export OS_TENANT_NAME=1234
    export OS_USER_DOMAIN_ID=default
    export OS_VERSION=kilo
    export OS_VOLUME_API_VERSION=2
    export OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION=2
    export OS_PASSWORD=********
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME=fg1234


The passwords will be masked with eight stars: `********`.
In case you like also to see the password you can use the --password flag.


register merge 
----------------

.. todo:: the description of what this is doing was ambigous, we need
	  to clarify if it only replaces to do or actually add things
	  that do not exist, or just overwrites.
	  
IN case you have already a yaml file, form another project
you can merge two of them into the same cloudmesh yaml file. You
simply have to specify the location of the file that you like to merge
into the existing yaml file. However, please be careful, as it will
overwrite the contents in ~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml

.. todo:: We used to have a .bak.# when we modified the yaml file, do
	  you still have this

Hence the command 

    $ cm register merge my_cloudmesh.yaml

This command allows the content from another yaml file to be merged into the
regular cloudmesh.yaml file. A backup of the old cloudmesh.yaml file is
created with an increased number.

.. note: The merge command is not tested



register form
---------------

In some cases it is nice to have an interactive mechanism to fill out
the missing yaml file information that is indicated with TBD. THis is
useful, if you do not have an editor at hand. Thus you can use the command::

  register form

  
It will interactively fills out the form wherever we find TBD::

    $ cm register form 
    Please enter email[TBD]:
    Editing the credentials for cloud india
    Please enter OS_TENANT_NAME[TBD]:
    Editing the credentials for cloud aws
    Please enter EC2_ACCESS_KEY[TBD]:
    Please enter EC2_SECRET_KEY[TBD]:
    Please enter keyname[TBD]:
    Please enter userid[TBD]:
    Editing the credentials for cloud azure
    Please enter managementcertfile[TBD]:
    Please enter servicecertfile[TBD]:
    Please enter subscriptionid[TBD]:
    Please enter thumbprint[TBD]:


register check
----------------------------------------------------------------------

o find any not filled out values, you can use the command::

  register check

which hecks the yaml file for completness and list all fields that
have the value TBD::

    $ cm register check
    ERROR: The file has 11 values to be fixed

      email: TBD
      username: TBD
      flavor: TBD
      EC2_ACCESS_KEY: TBD
      EC2_SECRET_KEY: TBD
      keyname: TBD
      userid: TBD
      managementcertfile: TBD
      servicecertfile: TBD
      subscriptionid: TBD
      thumbprint: TBD

register json HOST
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of using the cat command and listing the contents of a cloud
registration in yaml format you can also explicitly obtain a jason
representation by issueing the command::

  register json

It will return output in json format::

    $ cm register json azure
    {
        "cm_heading": "Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines",
        "cm_label": "waz",
        "cm_host": "windowsazure.com",
        "default": {
            "flavor": "ExtraSmall",
            "image": "b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-14_04_2-LTS-amd64-server-20150610-en-us-30GB",
            "location": "East US"
        },
        "credentials": {
            "managementcertfile": "TBD",
            "servicecertfile": "TBD",
            "subscriptionid": "TBD",
            "thumbprint": "TBD"
        },
        "cm_type": "azure",
        "cm_type_version": null
    }

register profile --username
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of modifying the profile username in the cloudmesh yaml file manually, this command provides a convenient way
of setting the username through cm shell::

	$ cm register profile --username=albert
	Username albert set successfully in the yaml settings.
