System Preparation - OLD DO NOT USE THIS SECTION
==================================================

The installation of cloudmesh is easiest if you prepare your system with
some elementary
software. We provide such information for the following Operating systems:

* Linux

  * Ubuntu
  * Centos
    
* OSX
* Windows

For each of these operating systems we are provide specific
installation instructions.

Prepare the system
------------------

OSX
^^^

On OSX we recommend that you use python 2.7.10. This version of python
is easy to install while downloading the dmg and installing it on the
system. You will still have access to the python version distributed
with the original OSX operating system.

To test out which version you have activated, you can use in the
commandline::

  python --version
  pip --version

They should show something similar to::

  Python 2.7.10
  pip 7.0.3

Oon OSX as well as the other operating systems we **require** you to
use virtualenv. First you need to find which version of python you
use. You can say::

  which python

It will give you the path of the python interpreter. Let us assume the
interpreter was found in `/usr/local/bin/python`.  Next you can create
a virtual ENV with::

  virtualenv -p /user/local/bin/python ~/ENV

You will need to activate the virtualenv::

  source ~/ENV/bin/activate

If sucessfull, your terminal will have (ENV) as prefix to the prompt::

  (ENV)machinename:dirname user$

As OSX comes with older versions of pip at this time, it is important
that you first prepare the environment before you install cloudmesh
client. To do so please isseue the following commands::

   
   export PYTHONPATH=~/ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
   pip install pip -U
   easy_install readline
   easy_install pycrypto
   pip install urllib3

.. warning:: We found that ``readline`` and ``pycrypto`` could not be
	  installed with pip at the time of writing of this manual,
	  despite the fact that pip installed it. Howerver, the
	  version installed with pip were not usable. The workaround
	  is to use easy_install for these packages. If you have a
	  better idea how to fix this, let us know and send mail to
	  laszewski@gmail.com.

It is recommended that you test the version of the python interpreter
and pip again::
   
   pip --version

which should give the version 7.1.2
   
::

   python --version


which should give the version Python 2.7.10

Install Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: python may come with cygwin and this may therefor be
	     uneccesarry. This needs to be investigated, and possibley
	     this sectin needs to be removed.
	     
Python can be found at http://www.python.org. We recommend to download
and install the newest version of python. At this time we recommend
that you use version 2.7.10. Other versions may work to, but are not
supported or tested. A direct link to the install can be found at

* https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/python-2.7.10.msi

In powershell you can type::

  explorer https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/python-2.7.10.msi

Thsi will open the Windows explorer, download the msi and ask you to
install it.

Once downloaded, open it by clicking on the downloaded file. You may
also want to change the properties and add python to the path

Install Git in Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To download and install git for windows, please go to

* https://git-scm.com/download/win

.. todo:: check if this is the right way to do so

You will be asked a couple of questions and you should make sure that
you install it so that git can be run from the terminal. Please
provide screenshots or write down what needs to be checked on.

.. image:: images/git_setup/git_setup.png

Install make In Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To download and install "make" for windows, please go to:

* http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/make.php

This will download the installer for make on your machine. Follow the
on-screen instructions and make will be installed. Next, you need to
add the location of "make.exe" to your system PATH environment variable.

Make.exe will most likely be installed at::

  C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\make.exe

Add this location to the PATH variable::

  PATH = %PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin;


Install chocolatey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We install cygwin via chocolatey. To do so you first have to start a
power shell as adminstrator with::

  PS> Start-Process powershell -Verb runAs

Allow execution of scripts::

  PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
  
Next execute the command to install chocolatey::
  
  PS> iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
  
Unset the script execution permission::
  
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted

Administrative Powershell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. note:: Often you will need to execute commands in an administrative powere
	  shell. You can right click or CTRL click (dependent on your
	  configuration) on the powereshell icon in order to obtain a powershell
	  with increased administrative rights. 
  
Install Cygwin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
Next execute in a powershell::
  
  choco install --force -y cygwin 
 
Note: if Cygwin is already installed, --force will reinstall it.

Install apt-cyg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now open cygwin window by clicking on the desktop icon. Put the
following command into Cygwin terminal (its shorcut can be found on
your Desktop)::
  
  lynx -source rawgit.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg > apt-cyg
  install apt-cyg /bin

This will give you a nice command to add additional packages to cygwin
without using the cygwin GUI. You will also want the following appliations::

  apt-cyg install wget
  apt-cyg install emacs
  apt-cyg install git
  apt-cyg install curl
  apt-cyg install nc
  apt-cyg install make
  apt-cyg install gcc-g++ diffutils libmpfr-devel libgmp-devel libmpc-devel
  apt-cyg install db

Using cygwin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When starting a new powershell terminal you can simply typ into it::

  cygwin

This way you can easily past and copy into the cywin terminal that is
started via powershell. This is extremly useful if you run Windows in
a virtual server and want to easily past and copy strings to and from
the host operating system. In virtualbox you maus enable past frm
clipboard in bidirectional mode.


Obsolete - Install Gnu Like tools 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
